Hybrid model is used for modules which is the best for managing code and readability.
* `app` module is responsible for managing navigation.
* `Feature` modules are compose ui pages and VMs and navigation setup for each page.
* `Core` folder has separate modules for networking and offline cache.
* For background tasks `WorkManager` library is used.
## Stack
* UI: [Jetpack Compose]()
* Database: [Room database]()
* Networking: [Retrofit]()
* Serialization: [Kotlinx.Serialization]()
* DI: [DaggerHilt]()
